# Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Innovations at Montefiore and Einstein (PCOR-PRIME): Materials to support planning and conducting <i>Stakeholder Studios</i>

<b>Background</b>

An important aim of PCOR-PRIME (1R25HS023199-01) is to enhance the quality of clinical and translational research through engagement of diverse community and scientific stakeholders. Consistent with the construct of a learning health system, stakeholder-engaged research can support innovative scientific discovery and promote evidence-based practice transformation to optimize patient outcomes and experiences, improve population health, and reduce health care costs. Via <i>Stakeholder Studios</i>, purposefully targeted representatives of one or more stakeholder groups serve in a consultative role, as project or community experts, to improve program or research procedures and outcomes (Jooten et al., 2015).

<b>Approach</b>

Stakeholder studios are one-time events organized on behalf of a project leader or principal investigator, usually scheduled at the beginning or end of a work day for a period of three hours, starting with a light meal (breakfast of dinner). The studio itself begins with a short presentation by the principal investigator that informs participants of proposed research aims, significance and design, and describes particular challenges or needs that stakeholders will help resolve. The participant expert discussion that follows is guided by a neutral facilitator to elicit authentic and constructive feedback. Careful selection of relevant stakeholders/community experts based on needs of the project (i.e. developmental, implementation, dissemination, etc.) is essential to the success of an given studio event, as is advance preparation and coaching to support the role of the researcher and participant experts.

<b>Studio Roles and Responsibilities</b>

<i>Project Lead/Prinicipal Investigator</i>. Presents a succinct slide set (Powerpoint) to 'pitch' the planned project or research to participating stakeholders, calling out specific issues or challenges to be addressed during the studio. This presentation is no longer that 10 minutes/10 slides.

<i>Stakeholder/Community Navigator</i>. Responsible for planning and conducting the pre-studio researcher meeting. A boundary spanner with experience working in the community and familiar with research.

<i>Facilitator</i>. Creates a neutral environment for open discussion between the researcher and the community experts.

<i>Studio Advisory Group</i>. Serves to provide on-going guidance and organizational support. Vets all SE Studio requests to assess appropriateness for Studio. Assists investigators with identifying stakeholders to fit needs of research project. Members have experience with patient-centered outcomes research, clinical practice improvement processes, community public relations, participatory action research, and program evaluation.

<b>Assessing the Project-Specific Need to Conduct a Studio</b>

1.	What challenges are you anticipating (recruitment, retention, invasiveness)?
2.	Is there a specific demographic that will be more difficult to reach (age, class, ethnicity)?
3.	What parts of the study are most arduous (consenting; activity)?
4.	What is your expected timeline for having results?
5.	Do you know what outcomes are of most importance to the target population?

<b>Potential Benefits of SE Studios</b>

<i>For Researchers</i>. Increases understanding of key stakeholders’ perspectives; Creates awareness of and insight into stakeholders’ priorities and needs.

<i>For Patient/Community and Other Stakeholders</i>. Increases understanding of research purpose and methods; Builds relationship with research community; Clarifies researcher’s motivations.
